  <h2>About</h2>
    <h3>An intimate documentary film that captures ten years in the life of a family living in North Philadelphia.</h3>
    <p>Synopsis: Filmed with vérité intimacy for over a decade, <em>QUEST</em> is the moving portrait of a family in North Philadelphia. Christopher “Quest” Rainey, along with his wife Christine’a, aka “Ma Quest,” open the door to their home music studio, which serves as a creative sanctuary from the strife that grips their neighborhood. Over the years, the family evolves as everyday life brings a mix of joy and unexpected crisis. Set against the backdrop of a country now in turmoil, <em>QUEST</em> is a tender depiction of an American family whose journey is a profound testament to love, healing and hope.</p>
    
  <p>Status: Our World Premiere will be in competition at Sundance Film Festival in January 2017!</p>
  <p>Supporters: In 2014 <em>Quest</em> was accepted into the IFP Documentary Lab. In 2015 Cinereach came on to support the film. In 2016 the film was awarded a MacArthur Foundation documentary film grant and entered into a co-production with ITVS. We are very grateful to our supporters whose investment will enable the film to reach its full potential.</p>
