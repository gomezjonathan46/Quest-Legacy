    <h2>About</h2>
    <h3>An intimate documentary film that captures ten years in the life of a family living in North Philadelphia.</h3>
    <p>Synopsis: Shot over nearly a decade, <em>Quest: the Fury and the Sound</em> was originally planned as a documentary portrait of the Rainey family and their home music studio, which serves as a special sanctuary within their North Philadelphia neighborhood.</p>
    
    <p>Status: We are currently in post production and we plan to release the film in 2017.</p>
    
    <p>Supporters: In 2014 <em>Quest: the Fury and the Sound</em> was accepted into the <a href="http://www.indiewire.com/article/ifp-sets-10-docs-for-its-10th-annual-indie-filmmaker-labs">IFP Documentary Lab</a>. In 2015 <a href="http://cinereach.org/films/quest-the-fury-and-the-sound/">Cinereach</a> came on to support the film. In 2016 the film was awarded a <a href="https://www.macfound.org/press/press-releases/macarthur-awards-19-documentary-film-grants/">MacArthur Foundation</a> documentary film grant and entered into a co-production with <a href="http://itvs.org/films/quest">ITVS</a>.
