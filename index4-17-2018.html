  <h2>About</h2>
    <h3>An intimate documentary film that captures ten years in the life of a family living in North Philadelphia.</h3>
    <p>Synopsis: Filmed with vérité intimacy for nearly a decade, <em>QUEST</em> is the moving portrait of the Rainey family living in North Philadelphia. Beginning at the dawn of the Obama presidency, Christopher "Quest" Rainey, and his wife, Christine'a "Ma Quest" raise a family while nurturing a community of hip hop artists in their home music studio. It's a safe space where all are welcome, but this creative sanctuary can't always shield them from the strife that grips their neighborhood. Epic in scope, <em>QUEST</em> is a vivid illumination of race and class in America, and a testament to love, healing and hope.</p><br />

  <h2>Note From Director</h2>
  <p>November 1, 2017</p>
  <p>Hi QUEST followers,</p>

<p>It has been an incredible year! I am very proud of the honors and accolades that QUEST has received, but the thing I value the most are the relationships. Festivals and critics often describe the film as a labor of love, but I have to say that I have been on the receiving end for a lot of it. Beginning with the Rainey family and the North Philadelphia community. To funders and supporters who cleared a path to get the film made. To the amazing film team who invested their hearts and souls along with their talents to craft the film. To audiences who experience the love in the story and reflect it back.</p> 

<p>I make films to make friends and it has been amazing to meet so many cool new people and to go deeper with partners that have been a part of this journey for a long time. Attending screenings has been super rewarding as I am able to witness the impact that the Rainey family's story has on audiences. The Raineys have been able to attend a number of festivals/screenings across the country and they have really been moved by the warmth and kindness they have received at these events. People often approach us after a screening to share their connection to moments in the film that relate to their own personal stories. These exchanges have been unforgettable.</p>

<p>I hope that, beyond building an initial connection with viewers, the film will spark real commitment to support and embrace communities like North Philadelphia. We are developing an impact and engagement campaign around the film to create a context for this to happen and we are looking for individuals and organizations to partner with us in this effort.</p>

<p>Every independent film needs champions to get made and I am so grateful to everyone who made this film possible. Now we need champions to help us get the word out so that we can bring this important story to more people. Thank you for being a part of this.</p>

<p>xo,</p>
<p>Jonathan Olshefski aka Peter Parker</p>

<p>Critic's Pick.

<p>"A beautiful film...evokes the peerless 'Hoop Dreams' and qualifies as a sort of longitudinal study. But there's nothing academic about it. To the contrary, Quest is intimate, warm yet unsentimental and agreeably rambling." <br />
